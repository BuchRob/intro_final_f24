                <p>Hi, I'm Robert ,Some call me Rob im a very shy person and not very good with interacting with others I get extreamly nervous but hopefully in the future we can become friends! I'm very excited and nervous to start this new career as I have no experience in this field so it very challanging for me but it very rewarding. My dream is to build websites and work with companys and start-up to make people dreams more of a reality not just a image or a thought and also to be able to provide for my family and love ones. Im currently enrolled in Code:you boot camp working hard to accomplish my dreams!! </p>
